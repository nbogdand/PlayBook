# PlayBook

This is an app specially made for listening to audiobooks. It will display a list of all audiobooks in the smartphone's memory 
(and songs, in current versions, just for me being able to test with a lager number of files being existent in the app, but this 
may no longer happen in future updates). Users will be able to fast-forward through tracks and rewind from special made buttons to 
ease their listening and understanding of the books. Also, other features may be developed and delivered as updates.

With this app, I will use best practices recommended by android developers, and some of the newly introduced libraries from Android
Architecture Components (ViewModel, LiveData and DataBinding). Furthermore, when the final stages of the app will come, I will try 
to create a decicated design using Adobe XD.
